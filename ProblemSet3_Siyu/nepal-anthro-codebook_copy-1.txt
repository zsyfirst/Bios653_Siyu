 				Nepal Data 

Description:

This data contains anthropologic measurements on Nepalese children.  The 
study design called for collecting measurements on 2258 kids at 5 time points, 
spaced approximately 4 months apart (11290 total observations).  However, some
of the visits contain missing data.  There are 9552 complete records on 2215 
kids. 

To make exploration of these data more feasible we have extracted only the
first 1000 records.

These data represent a subset of a larger study on the impact
of vitamin supplementation on growth.  These children represent the control 
arm of the trial.  Scientific aims of the study include:

	 characterize growth patterns of Nepalease children
	 characterize dependence of growth on covariates specific to the child 
		 as age and gender
	 characterize relationship between growth and maternal covariates
	 relationship between death and prior growth pattern

Structure: 

The data is in the file  "nepal.dat"  with white space separating the fields.

The following describes the variables:

id:
  There is a seven digit code for the child's ID:  2 digits for the panchayat
  number; 1 digit for the ward within panchayat; 3 digits for the household;
  1 digit for child within household.

age:
  Age of child in months

gender:
  Gender is coded: 1 = male; 2 =  female.

weight:
  Child's weight measured in kilograms.

height:
  Child's height measured in centimeters.

arm circumference:
  Child's mid upper arm circumference measured in centimeters.

breastfeeding:
  Indicates current level of breastfeeding:  0 = none; 1 = <10 times/day;
  2 = 10 or more times/day.

day:

month:

year:
  These 3 items denote the date of the child's visit.  The date is in
  Nepali calendar years - a lunar calendar.

mother's age:
  Mother's age in years.

literate:
  Indicator of mother's literacy:  0 = no; 1 = yes.

\# died:
  The number of kids the mother has had that died.\\
